# XBOX USERNAME CHECKER

### HOW TO USE
 1. Copy your **HTTPS** proxies into `https.txt`
 2. Run the `main.py` file
 3. Available usernames will be loaded onto multiple `.txt` files

### Note
 - most of the detected usernames will be names that cannot be used as they are deemed 'innapropriate' by Xbox.
 - it is recommended that you never delete the contents in the `checked.txt` file as that will make sure you don't check for the same name twice.
